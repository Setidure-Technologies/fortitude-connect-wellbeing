          <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">
            Vanshika Rao, the visionary behind Fortitude Network, was deeply influenced by her mother's courageous battle with cancer and the isolation that often accompanies the recovery journey. This inspired Vanshika to create a platform that bridges the gap between medical care and holistic support for cancer patients.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-4">
            Vanshika realized that while medical treatment is essential, the emotional and psychological challenges that patients face are just as critical. This understanding drives her mission to provide a support system that ensures no one feels alone in their battle.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-600 mb-6">
            Fortitude Network is Vanshika's way of turning a deeply personal experience into a platform that empowers others. By bringing together medical insights, mental health support, customized care plans, and a nurturing community, we aim to provide comprehensive and compassionate support for cancer patients.
